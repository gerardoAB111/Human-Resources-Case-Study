# Human Resources Case Study

This repository contains my **Human Resources case study project**, built to strengthen my data analytics portfolio.  
The dataset, originally published on Kaggle by Richard Huebner, includes detailed employee records such as demographics, job roles, compensation, performance, and termination history. 

In this project, I analyzed the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns in employee performance, retention, turnover, and pay equity, aiming to generate insights that could inform HR decision-making and strategy.

### Manager Performance
- Managers with a high percentage of employees exceeding expectations tend to have a leadership style that fosters an environment of high achievement.  
- Conversely, managers with more employees needing improvement may benefit from targeted leadership training or coaching.  
- The analysis shows that the **manager is a critical variable** in the employee performance equation.  

### Pay Equity
- In departments like **Sales** and **Admin Offices**, men earn about **2–3% more** than women.  
- A notable disparity was found among **Network Engineers**, where men earn approximately **32% more** than women.

## 📌 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made to guide HR strategy:

- **Managers & Teams:** Provide extra coaching to managers with struggling teams and assess if teams are too large or complex.  
- **Hiring & Diversity:** Focus on job fairs and other proven hiring platforms to attract a diverse talent pool.  
- **Keeping Employees:** Improve onboarding, conduct frequent check-ins, and time recognition or bonuses around periods of high turnover risk.  
- **Pay & Fairness:** Conduct regular audits to ensure pay equity, establish clear salary ranges, and fix identified gaps.  
- **Representation:** Create programs for young talent and set department-specific diversity goals.
  
**Note:** Although this case study was designed to also include predictive modeling and prescriptive analysis, I chose to focus only on descriptive analysis, as that is where my current knowledge is strongest.
